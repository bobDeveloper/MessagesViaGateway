MessagesViaGateway Product Quality

The application works fine, send the right messages to gateway, no matter how many messages they have been send. Has a low complexity in sorting the messages, because its done in one step, so the time consumed is not long.
From the task objectives the application covers:
1. receives Messages (and queues them up if they cannot be processed)
2. sends the correct message to the gateway

The application selects the right messages, the messages are processed from a list and sorted properly

Forwarding: for a single resource, when one message is received, that message is send to the gateway 
			for two resources (not covered)

Queueing: covered partially

Responding:	covered
